    "The def functions must be declared in the namespace whereas the lambda functions can be used without any declaration in the namespace.\n",
    "Def Statement is to return an object from the function, return should be explicitly defined whereas in lambda function no need of using the return statement.\n",

    "Lambda functions can’t use regular Python statements and always include an implicit return statement.\n",
    "The lambda keyword provides a shortcut for declaring small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used whenever function objects are required."
